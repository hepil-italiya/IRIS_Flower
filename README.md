Internship Accomplishments at CodSoft: Data Science with IRIS Flower Dataset ðŸŒ¼
IRIS Flower Dataset

Introduction
I am thrilled to share the accomplishments of my enriching internship at CodSoft, where I delved into the world of data science with a focus on the IRIS Flower dataset. This internship has been an exciting journey of learning, exploration, and practical application.

Work 1: IRIS Flower Classification using Machine Learning
In the first part of my internship, I had the opportunity to work on the IRIS Flower dataset and implement a range of classification algorithms. These algorithms included:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
Linear Discriminant Analysis
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Support Vector Classification
My objective was to predict the species of IRIS flowers accurately. It was a hands-on experience where I got to apply these algorithms, understand their strengths and weaknesses, and fine-tune them to achieve precise predictions.

Work 2: Unraveling Insights from IRIS Flower Dataset
The second part of my internship involved conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover meaningful insights from the IRIS Flower dataset. I explored the relationships between different features and flower species, gaining valuable insights that could be used for further analysis and decision-making.
